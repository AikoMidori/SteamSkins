# Shiina's Steam Skins
With Steam's new beta and introduction to full css clients, and the removal of VGUI, means a new era of skins.

<b>CHANGELOG</b>:

- Adds support for new Steam Beta ChromiumUI update as of 2023-04-27 with a new beta v1 release of Fluent for Steam.
- Installation for stable version of Steam is the same as previous release (actually, nothing changes), while you must follow new instructions below if you are participating in Steam Beta.

# Credits
The Skins are fully developed by me, and are part of pre-existing communities:
  - [Fluent for Steam by Opurojogo](https://www.fluentforsteam.io/)
  - [Unofficial Metro for Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/metroskin)

These skins originate from the baseUI of the Metro for Steam 4.4 by minischetti and Unofficial Patch MetroSkin from RedSigma.
Bew releases of Fluent & Metro are being developed by @AikoMidori and it requires prior installation of the Millenium Patcher by @ShadowMonster99.


# Patching
<b>USAGE</b> (for Steam Beta):

1. Install Millenium Patcher from [here](https://github.com/ShadowMonster99/millennium-steam-patcher/releases)
1. Copy all the DLL files to your steam root directory and copy the skins folder into steamui directory.
3. Proceed into your skins folder and rename skin-example to Fluent or Metro, afterwards open settings.json and set `"active-skin": "skin-example",`
to `"active-skin": "Fluent",` or `"active-skin": "Metro"`, and change `true` to `false`. `"show-console": false,`
4. Download my files, and replace the Metro or Fluent folder you just created, click replace all when prompted.
5. Create a shortcut of steam.exe, then run it with the following command line arguments: -cef-enable-debugging.
You should now see the Fluent or Metro skin.

Keep in mind that the Patcher and Steam's Beta are still in the first stage, expect glitches and bugs.
