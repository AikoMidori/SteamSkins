<b>TO-DO & TO-COME</b>:

# Credits
The Skins are fully developed by me, and are part of pre-existing communities:
  - [Fluent for Steam by Opurojogo](https://www.fluentforsteam.io/)
  - [Unofficial Metro for Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/metroskin)

These skins originate from the baseUI of the Metro for Steam 4.4 by minischetti and Unofficial Patch MetroSkin from RedSigma.
New releases of Fluent & Metro are being developed by @AikoMidori and it requires prior installation of the Millenium Patcher by @ShadowMonster99 or SFP by @PhantomGamers


# Patching
## <b>Millennium</b>

1. Install Millenium Patcher from [here](https://github.com/ShadowMonster99/millennium-steam-patcher/releases)
2. Copy all the DLL files to your steam root directory and copy the skins folder into steamui directory.
3. Proceed into your skins folder and rename skin-example to Fluent or Metro, afterwards open settings.json and set `"active-skin": "skin-example",`
to `"active-skin": "Fluent",` or `"active-skin": "Metro"`, and change `true` to `false`. `"show-console": false,`
4. Download my files, and replace the Metro or Fluent folder you just created, click replace all when prompted.
